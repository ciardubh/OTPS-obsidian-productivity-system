### This guide is a work-in-progress, I originally built this system just for my own use and wasn't keeping good documentation. Apologies in advance...
#### The templates assume you have an autoimmune disorder and ADHD. Feel free to edit the templates to remove some of the excess parameters if your life is going better than that.

This guide will help you set up the comprehensive productivity management system in Obsidian that includes task scheduling, project management, and routine creation.

## Tips for Getting Started

1. Set up a few sample projects and areas to get familiar with the system
2. Run the task scheduler daily or when you add new tasks
3. Use the emergency protocols when needed
4. Schedule regular weekly/monthly reviews
5. Start with critical projects first, then gradually add more content
   
## Prerequisites

1. [Download and install Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Basic familiarity with Markdown syntax (or you can be happy just blindly copying and pasting from me)
   
## Step 1: Install Required Plugins

2. Configure QuickAdd to run the script:
    - Go to QuickAdd settings
    - Create a new Macro
    - Name it "Task Scheduler"
    - Add a new "User Script" action
    - Point it to the `task-scheduler.js` file

    - Name it "Advance Project Stage"
    - Add a new "User Script" action
    - Point it to the `advance-project-stage.js` file
    - Save the macro
    - Add the macro to your QuickAdd choices
      
## Step 5: Configure Daily Notes

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Daily Notes
2. Set the new file location to `06-Daily`
3. Set the template file to your daily note template in `05-Templates`
4. Configure the date format as desired

## Step 6: Configure Weekly/Monthly Reviews

First, create these folders in your vault:

```
üìÅ 00-Dashboard/
   üìÅ reviews/
      üìÅ weekly/
      üìÅ monthly/
   üìÑ productivity-metrics.md
```

### Template Installation

1. Add the Weekly and Monthly Review templates to your `05-Templates` folder:
   - `05-Templates/weekly-review.md`
   - `05-Templates/monthly-review.md`

2. Copy the Productivity Metrics Dashboard to:
   - `00-Dashboard/productivity-metrics.md`

### Plugin Configuration

#### Periodic Notes Plugin Setup

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Periodic Notes
2. Enable Weekly Notes and Monthly Notes
3. Configure paths:
   - Weekly notes path: `00-Dashboard/reviews/weekly`
   - Monthly notes path: `00-Dashboard/reviews/monthly`
4. Set templates:
   - Weekly template: `05-Templates/weekly-review.md`
   - Monthly template: `05-Templates/monthly-review.md`

#### Templater Configuration

For the date variables in templates to work correctly:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Templater
2. Enable "Trigger Templater on new file creation"
3. Add template folder: `05-Templates`

### Workflow Integration

#### Weekly Reviews (30-45 minutes)

Schedule a recurring time each week (e.g., Friday afternoon or Sunday evening) to:

1. Open the Weekly Note for the current week
2. Complete all reflection questions
3. Review task completion and wellness metrics
4. Plan priorities for the upcoming week

#### Monthly Reviews (60-90 minutes)

Schedule a recurring time at the end of each month to:

1. Open the Monthly Note for the current month
2. Review weekly notes from the month
3. Analyze larger patterns and trends
4. Make system adjustments as needed
5. Set monthly priorities and project targets

#### Dashboard Usage

Use the Productivity Metrics Dashboard as a reference during reviews to:

1. Identify trends in task completion
2. Spot patterns in your wellness scores
3. Evaluate project progress velocity
4. Detect ADHD pattern triggers

Your review system will help you track:

1. **Task Completion Rates** - How many tasks you complete vs. create
2. **Wellness Score Trends** - How your energy/focus fluctuates
3. **Project Velocity** - How quickly you move projects through stages
4. **ADHD Pattern Recognition** - Identifying triggers and effective strategies
5. **System Usage Consistency** - How regularly you use your system

## Step 7: Task Usage Guide

Ensure you understand the task formatting system:

- Basic task: `- [ ] Task description`
- Task with time estimate: `- [ ] Task description #time 1h`
		- Time estimates take h or m: `2.5h` or `30m`
  			- The task scheduling script assumes 1hr per task if you don't add a time estimate
			- The time tag has a tendency to break the due date if you place it after. So estimate time before adding a due date, if there is a due date
- Task with due date: `- [ ] Task description üìÖ YYYY-MM-DD`
- Task with criticality: `- [ ] Task description #critical`
- Complete format: `- [ ] Task description #time 1h üìÖ YYYY-MM-DD #critical`
- Sequential tasks: `- [ ] [1] First task #seq`

Criticality levels are important for emergency protocols:

- `#critical` - Must be done on the scheduled day, even when sick
- `#important` - Could be delayed by 1 day in emergency
- `#flexible` - Can be rescheduled during emergency periods

## Step 8: Running the Task Scheduler

1. Click the QuickAdd button in the left sidebar
2. Select "Task Scheduler" from your choices
3. Let it run (it may take a few moments)
4. Review the generated report in the `00-Dashboard` folder

# Additional Tools

## Workload Calendar Tool

The workload calendar tool allows you to quickly visualize your task workload for the upcoming month without modifying any tasks. This is perfect for a quick overview of your schedule and identifying overbooked days.

### Setting Up the Workload Calendar

1. **Add the script file**
   
   - Download or copy the `workload-calendar.js` script
   - Place it in your `05-Templates` folder in your vault

2. **Create a QuickAdd Macro**
   
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí QuickAdd
   - Click on "Manage Macros"
   - Click "Add Macro" and name it "Generate Workload Calendar"
   - Click on the newly created macro to configure it
   - Click "Add Action" and select "User Script"
   - In the Script Path field, enter `05-Templates/workload-calendar.js`
   - Click "Add User Script"
   - Save the configuration

3. **Add the Macro to QuickAdd Choices**
   
   - Still in the QuickAdd settings, scroll to the top 
   - Under "Choices," click "Add Choice"
   - Name it "Workload Calendar"
   - Set the type to "Macro"
   - Select "Generate Workload Calendar" from the macro dropdown
   - Click "Add Choice"
   - You can drag to reorder the choices if needed
   - Save the configuration

### Using the Workload Calendar

1. Trigger QuickAdd (default hotkey is `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` on Mac)
2. Select "Workload Calendar" from the menu
3. The script will run and generate a visual calendar showing your workload for the next 30 days
4. The calendar will appear in a new note in your `00-Dashboard` folder
5. The visualization shows:
   - A bar representing your workload for each day
   - Your total hours scheduled vs. available hours
   - The percentage of capacity used
   - The number of tasks scheduled for each day

The calendar respects your day-specific scheduling configuration, showing accurate workload percentages based on your available hours per day of the week.

### Customizing the Calendar

You can adjust the following settings at the top of the script file:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  dailyHours: {
    0: 0,  // Sunday: 0 hours
    1: 6,  // Monday: 6 hours
    2: 6,  // Tuesday: 6 hours
    3: 6,  // Wednesday: 6 hours
    4: 6,  // Thursday: 6 hours
    5: 6,  // Friday: 6 hours
    6: 0,  // Saturday: 0 hours
  },
  defaultTaskTime: 1,      // Default time (in hours) for tasks without a time estimate
  projectionDays: 30,      // Number of days to show in the calendar
  barLength: 20,           // Length of the visual bar in the calendar
  includeTaskList: false   // Set to true if you want detailed task lists
};
```

To see detailed task lists for each day, set `includeTaskList` to `true`.
